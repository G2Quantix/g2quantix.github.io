**G2 Quantix Solutions** empowers biotech and pharma organizations to turn complex biological data into actionable insights—accelerating R&D and therapeutic innovation.

Founded by **Gary Ge, Ph.D.**, a seasoned expert with over 15 years in computational drug discovery and development, G2 Quantix offers deep expertise in building scalable data and analytics platforms. Gary led the development of **OmicSoft’s flagship products**, including **ArrayServer**, a robust multi-omics data management system, and **OncoLand** and **DiseaseLand**, curated omics data solutions that power AI-driven drug discovery. These platforms are widely adopted by leading global biopharma companies. His work at **Amgen** and **Vor Bio** spans the full R&D data lifecycle, supporting scientific operations and regulatory filings with both strategic planning and technical depth.

## What We Do
### <i class="fas fa-database fa-lg"></i> Research Informatics and Data Management
We design and customize cloud-native ELN, LIMS, and data lakes to make data AI-ready, guiding teams with nearly a decade of Bio-IT experience across top pharma and biotech companies.

### <i class="fa fa-cog fa-lg"></i> Development of AI/ML Solutions
We help build predictive models using high-quality local data—such as single-cell perturbation or antibody screening—to drive target discovery and design with lab-in-the-loop AI powered by foundational models.

### <i class="fas fa-dna fa-lg"></i> Computational Biology and Bioinformatics 
Bioinformatics is essential to modern biotech. We build semi-automated, reproducible workflows for genomic analysis—freeing computational biologists from routine tasks to focus on in silico discovery and innovation.

### <i class="fas fa-cut fa-lg"></i> Gene Editing Analysis
We guide gene editing optimization and assay design, delivering FDA-ready data packages—built on five years of experience in on- and off-target genotoxicity assessments and regulatory interactions for [_trem-cel_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2329050123001742) and CD33-targeted CAR-T programs.

### <i class="fas fa-rocket fa-lg"></i> Build Amazing Companies/Ventures
With experience from building **OmicSoft** ([acquired by QIAGEN](https://corporate.qiagen.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/QIAGEN-enhances-bioinformatics-portfolio-with-acquisition-of-OmicSoft/default.aspx)) and scaling **Vor Bio**, we support strategic decisions, from software evaluation, product development to fundraising, and can serve as interim CDO or Head of Computational Biology.
