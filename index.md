**Turning complex biological data into clarity, strategy, and innovation.**

Biotech and pharma face unprecedented challenges‚Äîconstrained budgets, data complexity, and the need for faster R&D decisions. **G2 Quantix Solutions** empowers organizations to cut through the noise, transforming biological and clinical data into actionable insights that accelerate discovery, development, and company growth.  

Founded by **Gary Ge, Ph.D.**, a computational drug discovery and data strategy leader with 15+ years of experience, G2 Quantix brings a unique blend of **scientific depth and executive perspective**. Gary helped build and scale **OmicSoft‚Äôs flagship products** (ArrayServer, OncoLand, DiseaseLand)‚Äîplatforms now relied upon by 15 of the top 20 global biopharma companies. His leadership at **Amgen** and **Vor Bio** spanned the full R&D data lifecycle, from early discovery through regulatory filings, balancing **technical rigor with strategic direction**.  

## **Our Expertise**
We help biotech and pharma teams unlock the value of their data, using approaches that are both **cutting-edge and practical**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è AI/ML for Drug Discovery  
We design predictive models grounded in **biological reality**‚Äîfrom single-cell perturbation to compound and antibody screening. Our lab-in-the-loop AI approach, built on foundation models and active learning, accelerates target discovery while staying data-driven and credible.

### üóÑÔ∏è Research Informatics & Data Platforms  
We architect and customize cloud-native ELN, LIMS, and data lakes that are **AI-ready by design**. With nearly a decade of Bio-IT experience across leading pharma and biotech, we ensure your infrastructure enables‚Äînot hinders‚Äîinnovation.

### üß¨ Computational Biology & Bioinformatics  
From genomics to multi-omics, we build **automated, reproducible workflows** that free your scientists from repetitive analysis. Our solutions integrate seamlessly into discovery pipelines, empowering your team to focus on novel insights.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Gene Editing Analytics  
We bring proven expertise in **gene editing assay design and optimization** (Cas9, Cas12a, ABE, CBE). With 5+ years in genotoxicity assessment and FDA interactions, we deliver regulatory-grade data packages for emerging therapies‚Äîfrom multiplexed editing to CAR-T.

### üöÄ Strategic Biotech Advisory  
Having scaled **OmicSoft** ([acquired by QIAGEN](https://corporate.qiagen.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/QIAGEN-enhances-bioinformatics-portfolio-with-acquisition-of-OmicSoft/default.aspx)) and guided **Vor Bio** through growth, we support companies at critical inflection points. We advise on CRO partnerships, product strategy, fundraising, and can step in as **interim CDO/CTO or Head of Computational Biology**.
